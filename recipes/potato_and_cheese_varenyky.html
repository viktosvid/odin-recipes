   <h2>Description</h2>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>water as needed</li>
        <li>5 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 pound processed cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>onion salt to taste</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook
            until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, eggs and salt. Mix in a little water at a time until
            dough is somewhat stiff. Roll dough in small sections about 1/4
            inch thick. Using a large biscuit cutter or drinking glass, make
            circle cuts.</li>
        <li>To make filling: Mix together potatoes, cheese, salt, pepper and
            onion salt. Fill each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture,
            fold over and seal edges. To cook, bring a large pot of water to boil,
            carefully dropping in one at a time; stir once. They are done when
            they float to the top.</li>
    </ol>
